# Malicious_User_Detection

## Key Features

- Generated an application to classify user behavior into malicious or benign.
- We used KDD Cup'99 dataset as base for creating the dataset.
- We have modified the dataset and kept only numerical data for creating our ML model easily.
- We have used multiple ML classification algorithms.
- Ploted a graph for comparing results using Plotly.

## Algorithms Used

We have used below ML classifiers. We used built-in functions for these algorithms from from Pythonâ€™s Scikit learn library to perform comparative performance analysis on the same.

- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine(SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)
- Multilayer Perceptron(MLP)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly
- Scikit-Learn

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Or you can upload the dataset and copy the code to a Google Collab notebook for the execution.
4. Run the Python code to explore the results.
5. Check the interactive plot for more details.
