# Malicious_User_Detection

## Key Features

- Generated an application to classify user behavior into malicious or benign.
- We used KDD Cup'99 dataset as base for creating the dataset.
- We have modified the dataset and kept only numerical data for creating our ML model easily.
- We have used multiple ML classification algorithms.
- Ploted a graph for comparing results using Plotly.

## Algorithms Used

We have used below ML classifiers. We used built-in functions for these algorithms from from Pythonâ€™s Scikit learn library to perform comparative performance analysis on the same.

- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine(SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)
- Multilayer Perceptron(MLP)
